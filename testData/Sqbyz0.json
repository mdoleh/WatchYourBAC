Made with only the finest ingredients - fresh orange peel, coriander and secret spices, this brew stands up to it's iconic name.  The polka dots on the label are a tip of the hat to his style; he promised his Mother a polka dot Cadillac after he hit it big, but sadly, he wasn't able to do so before she passed.   So, so you'll see the poke dots in everything around him, from his guitar to his clothes... and now on his very own brew!  It's the \"Damn Right Beer\" to quench your thirst.","abv":"5.6","styleId":65,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/Sqbyz0/upload_AS6sEL-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/Sqbyz0/upload_AS6sEL-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/Sqbyz0/upload_AS6sEL-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"This beer can be enjoyed with everything from a BBQ sandwich to Thai Food - but it goes best with friends and some good tunes.","createDate":"2014-06-04 15:06:54","updateDate":"2015-12-17 13:28:26","style":{"id":65,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style White (or Wit) / Belgian-Style Wheat","shortName":"Witbier","description":"Belgian white ales are very pale in color and are brewed using unmalted wheat and malted barley and are spiced with coriander and orange peel. Coriander and light orange peel aroma should be perceived as such or as an unidentified spiciness. Phenolic spiciness and yeast flavors may be evident at mild levels. These beers are traditionally bottle conditioned and served cloudy. An unfiltered starch and yeast haze should be part of the appearance. The low to medium body should have some degree of creaminess from wheat starch. The style is further characterized by the use of noble-type hops to achieve low hop bitterness and little to no apparent hop flavor. This beer has no diacetyl and a low to medium fruity-ester level. Mild acidity is appropriate.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"17","abvMin":"4.8","abvMax":"5.2","srmMin":"2","srmMax":"4","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.01","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:32:30"}}}
