{"data":{"id":"N0Ux18","name":"Buddy Black IPA","nameDisplay":"Buddy Black IPA","description":"Buddy is a big, bold, in-your-face beer. At 9.1%, Buddy is the largest of our year-round beers, and it incorporates many of our favorite tools in the craft beer toolbox: it's hopped like crazy, it's loaded with rye malt, and it's pitch black. You've gotta be brave to try this one, but those that love it, would kill for it.","abv":"9.1","ibu":"88","glasswareId":8,"srmId":32,"availableId":1,"styleId":41,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","servingTemperature":"cool","servingTemperatureDisplay":"Cool - (8-12C/45-54F)","originalGravity":"1.082","createDate":"2013-08-12 16:49:58","updateDate":"2014-10-16 20:23:58","glass":{"id":8,"name":"Tulip","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":32,"name":"32","hex":"5A0A02"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":41,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Black Ale","shortName":"Black Ale","description":"American-style Black Ales are very dark to black and perceived to have medium high to high hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content, balanced with a medium body.
